When I do something with my PC, I usually make random things like website. But, I don't often make something like this. So, why did I make this website?\
I'll explain it here. but, I don't have that many things to explain.

## TL;DR
- My friends were making _modern_ websites with AI, so i wanted to compete with them, **without using any AI**
- I used many websites as a reference to make this website
- Some of my friends were amazed seeing this website, but I don't think I surpassed AI yet.
- Using AI as a helper is okay, but abusing it to harm people is terrible.

## The reason
It's actually simple.

My friends were making a _modern_ websites with AI <small>(especially Horizon Alpha)</small>, and they even used it in one of their projects.\
So, I suddenly wanted to compete with them.


My goal was to make a modern website, with a condition of **not using any AI**.\
That means I have to manually search something to solve it. And I struggled so much.

## Making the "modern" website
If you've visited <Link href="https://nuxt.com" target="_blank">Nuxt website</Link>, you might feel something similar <Link href="/#top">at the top, in the home page of this website</Link>.\
This is because I used <Link href="https://nuxt.com" target="_blank">Nuxt website</Link> as a reference so much.

I tried to make the modern website by using many websites as a reference. But, when I try something, most of times it doesn't look well.\
I couldn't waste a lot of times. So I stopped it there <small>(at least for now)</small>.

## My friends' reaction
When I posted screenshots of this website on Discord and X, my friends were amazed, kind of.\
Some friends said this website is cool, some friends said "i think this is pretty well-made".

But I personally think I didn't surpass AI yet.

## What I thought
I already published this website. But, I still haven't finished making this website yet.\
...while I was writing this blog, the friend made their website with AI. Yes, that AI designed their website, not the friend themself.

Well, I think using AI as an advicer or a helper is not bad. I sometimes use AI when I couldn't solve something too.

But, using AI to make some entire artworks, or ruining someone's artworks, and **saying that they made it** is very stupid and terrible.\
I've seen many artists' artworks being adjusted by AI, and **being said that AI version is better**.\
I've never uploaded any arts on the intenet. But, I can imagine that this is so painful for the original artists.\
If the artist doesn't want their artworks to be trained by AI, please respect them.\
Every time I see that, my <small>(our)</small> heart hurts.

I might made this website for that reason. I'm not sure.\
I just casually made this.
