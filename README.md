# Laselxt website
This is a website for Laselxt.

## Questions
### Why did you make this?
The answer is simple.\
Two of my friends were using AI to make a modern website, and actually used it in one of their projects.\
So I casually wanted to compete with them.

### why give it the weird name "Laselxt"?
I tried to make a website with Next.js again. and I needed a brand name (obviously not real though) for this website.\
So I combined `lase` (a part of my handle name) and `next` (because **next**.js). but you surely know why i didn't use it as it is.\
I put a `l` in the combination (i tried `r` too, but `l` felt right). That's all.

### So will you make Laselxt real in the future?
I think I'm not going to make it real.\
But maybe, if I changed my mind in the future, or someone wanted to make it real, it might happen.
